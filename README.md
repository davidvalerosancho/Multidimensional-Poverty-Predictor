# Multidimensional-Poverty-Predictor

Final Project for my DS and Big Data master course.

Welcome to Multidimensional Poverty Predictor! This project applies machine learning to the study of poverty. Using the EU-SILC multidimensional material deprivation indicator as target variable it aims at building a prediction model based on relevant sociodemographic variables.

The following libraries are needed to replicate the repository:

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* sklearn
* ipynb
* gdown
* streamlit

Please head down to memory.pdf for a datailed explanation of the project.

All the notebooks are sorted in numerical order. Access the notebooks accordingly and follow along with the memory.

* Notebooks 1.1 to 1.4 decode the source data and map it into english.
* Notebook 2 merges the decoded data frames into one
* Notebook 3 selects and transforms questions from the original survey into variables for the model
* Notebook 4 performs data preprocessing and feuture selection to the created variables
* Notebook 5.1 to 5.6 applies different classification models

The data can be accessed through the code in the notebooks. It can also be downloaded from the Data directory.
